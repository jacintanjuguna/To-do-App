# Takeaway and Thoughts
  
This is a really cool up similar to the notes app only that Local storage function was used meaning the data stored in the browser will persist even after windows is closed or refreshed.The EventListener used to add a new todo on click and and to actually prevent default method whenever the to do is submitted.On right click,the to do is toggled and on left click it shows completed(removed).
